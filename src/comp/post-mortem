Technical Review

    What part of the project went well, technically? Give at least one link to your repo as an example.

    How data flowed & how the code is easily seperable, I can work on different things without worrying about how they might break up other pieces. Eg. readyForGame(gameInfo) function


    What part the project was a struggle, technically? Give at least one link to your repo as an example.

    Generally my understanding of Axios & Express and differentiating them was giving me most of my technical trouble. I also got stuck on the game/winning logic for 2 days.

    What technical adjustments would you make for the next project? Why?

    Would have worked directly on the MVP & start with the Sign in page so I could get a rough feel of how the user data would be passed into the lobby page & how games would then be set up accordingly. 

Process Review

    What in the approach and process during this project went well?

    Probably because of the MVC/Webpack framework, code is much easier to dissect and find where the problem lies, it is a double-edged sword though as I need more screen real-estate.

    What in the approach and process during this project did not go well?

    Feel disappointed in the overall result of my project. Felt it was sub-par. I was struggling the week prior to understand axios/express and their interaction fully, perhaps I could have re-do the previous exercises again before working on my project.

    What would you change in your process and approach in the next project? Why?

    I would spend more time with instructor(s) to clarify as much as they would be willing to before starting on the project.

    Again, I understand better now how important it is to get the MVP done first. 
    My MVP would be: Login -> Lobby (without leaderbord) -> Game -> Game Logic -> Ability to rejoin Games.
